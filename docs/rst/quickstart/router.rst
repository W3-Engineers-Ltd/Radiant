Project routing settings
========================

The previous section covered creating and running a Radiant project.
This section will investigate the operation of the main file (main.go):

::

   package main

   import (
           _ "quickstart/routers"
           "github.com/W3-Engineers-Ltd/Radiant/server/web"
   )

   func main() {
           web.Run()
   }

This code imports the package ``quickstart/routers``. This file contains
the following (routers/router.go):

::

   package routers

   import (
           "quickstart/controllers"
           "github.com/W3-Engineers-Ltd/Radiant/server/web"
   )

   func init() {
           web.Router("/", &controllers.MainController{})
   }

There are two relevant lines here; ``web.Router`` and ``web.Run``.

1. ``web.Router`` is used to register a router address. This command
   accepts two arguments. The first argument specifes the request uri,
   which is ``/`` here to indicate that no uri is requested. The second
   argument is used to indicate the Controller that will handle requests
   for this uri.

Alternately, a router can be registered in this format:

::

       web.Router("/user", &controllers.UserController{})

The user can visit ``/user`` to invoke the logic in UserController. For
further information on router usage please see `radiant router
settings <../mvc/controller/router.html>`__.

2. ``web.Run`` will actively listen on the specified port when executed.
   The following tasks are performed behind the scenes upon execution:

-  Parse the `configuration file <../mvc/controller/config.html>`__
   Radiant will parse the configuration file ``app.conf`` in conf folder
   to change the port, enable session management and set the
   applicationâ€™s name.

-  Initialize the `user session <../mvc/controller/session.html>`__
   Radiant will initialize the user session, based on the setting in the
   configuration file.

-  Compile the `views <view.html>`__ Radiant will compile the views in the
   views folder. This is done on startup to avoid compiling multiple
   times and improve efficiency.

-  Starting the `supervisor module <../advantage/monitor.html>`__ By
   visiting port ``8088`` the user can access information about QPS,
   cpu, memory, GC, goroutine and thread information.

-  Listen on the service port Radiant will listen http requests on port
   ``8080``. It takes advantage of goroutines by calling
   ``ListenAndServe``.

-  When the application is running our server will serve incoming
   requests from port ``8080`` and supervising from port ``8088``.

The next section will cover the operation of the controller `next
section <controller.html>`__.
