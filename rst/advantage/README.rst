Advanced Radiant
================

We have demonstrated the basic usage of Radiant. Now we will talk about
more advanced topics.

-  `In process monitor <./monitor.html>`__

   Radiant will serve as two ports by default. One is 8080 for
   application to serve users. Another is 8088, to monitor the process
   status, execute tasks and so on.

-  `Filters <../mvc/controller/filter.html>`__

   Filters is a very convenient feature for you to extend your logic.
   You can easily implement user authentication, log visiting,
   compatibility switching and so on.


   Reload is always mentioned in web development that allows deploying
   application without interrupt user requests.

         This feature is not well done yet. It only tested on Mac and
         Linux. It haven’t been tested on production environment yet.
         It’s still under testing, so take your own risk to use it. It’s
         recommended to use upstream of nginx.
